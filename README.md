### Angular Ivy

This project is using version 8 of angular but Ivy is not enabled. I'm trying to do it, but some errors appear during this process. I would accept any pull request about this because no one till now knows what to do...

### Angular Universal and i18n

This project is deployed in firebase using Angular Universal and the official i18n. You can navigate through every language and reload (and share) every page in the application without losing context. This is very useful for SEO purposes and you almost have a ready for production app.
If you want to translate the messages you can use this awesome tool, [Tiny Translator](https://martinroob.github.io/tiny-translator/en/#/translate) or follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/martinroob/ngx-i18nsupport/wiki/Tutorial-for-using-xliffmerge-with-angular-cli).

I've created a medium post where you can find a tutorial to apply this concepts to your own project. [Check it here](https://medium.com/@ismaestro/angular-7-example-app-with-angularcli-angular-universal-i18n-official-firebase-66deac2dc31e), and let me know what do you think.

### Firebase

This repo is using Firebase. We use Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage to handle CRUD operations over the heroes and to store their images. Also Hosting and Functions to deploy the app with Universal.

## Travis CI

We use Travis CI to run this tasks in order:
* Linter
* Unit tests
* End to end tests
* Build for production of browser and server
* Validate that server generated using curl
* Sonar
* Deploy to Firebase

## Quick start

**WARNING**

> Verify that you are running node 10.16.0 by running node -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.
