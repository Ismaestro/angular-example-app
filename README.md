### Angular Universal and i18n

This project is using firebase and Angular Universal with the official internationalization. You can
navigate through every language and reload (and share) every page in the application without losing
context. This is very useful for SEO purposes and you almost have a ready for production app. If you
want to translate the messages you can use this awesome tool,
[Tiny Translator](https://martinroob.github.io/tiny-translator/en/#/translate) or follow
[this tutorial](https://github.com/martinroob/ngx-i18nsupport/wiki/Tutorial-for-using-xliffmerge-with-angular-cli).

I've created a medium post where you can find a tutorial to apply this concepts to your own project.
[Check it here](https://medium.com/@ismaestro/angular-7-example-app-with-angularcli-angular-universal-i18n-official-firebase-66deac2dc31e),
and let me know what do you think.

### Firebase

This repo is using Firebase. We use Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage to handle CRUD operations over
the heroes and to store their images.

## Travis CI

We use Travis CI to run this tasks in order:

- Linter
- Unit tests
- End to end tests
- Build for production of browser and server
- Validate that server generated using curl
- Sonar scanner

**WARNING**

> Verify that you are running node 12.4.0 by running node -v in a terminal/console window. Older
